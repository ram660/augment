# Archive

This folder contains legacy or informational documents that have been superseded by content in `docs/` or by the implemented UI/API. They are preserved for historical context and can be referenced as needed.

Moved here:

- STREAMLIT_README.md — Streamlit usage now covered by README and in-app guidance.
- UI_SETUP_COMPLETE.md — Historical setup log for the UI.
- SETUP_COMPLETE.md — Historical setup log for backend/API.
- DOCUMENTATION_REORGANIZATION.md — Summary preserved; primary docs live in `docs/`.
- DIGITAL_TWIN_VISUALIZATION_PLAN.md — Plan preserved; implementation now reflected in code and docs.

If you rely on any of these, consider linking to the newer docs under `docs/`.
