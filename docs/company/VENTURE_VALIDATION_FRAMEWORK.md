## Assumption A1: Homeowner Decision Paralysis

### Problem Statement

Homeowners planning renovations experience significant decision paralysis due to:
- Uncertainty about what's possible in their space
- Lack of accurate cost information
- Difficulty finding trustworthy contractors
- Fear of making expensive mistakes

This paralysis leads to project delays (months to years) or complete abandonment of renovation plans.

### Hypothesis

**If this problem is real, then:**
- ≥60% of interviewed homeowners will report delaying a renovation project due to cost uncertainty
- ≥50% will report spending 2+ weeks researching options without making progress
- ≥40% will report getting contractor quotes with >30% price variance
- ≥70% will express frustration with the current home improvement process

### Validation Methods

#### Method 1: Customer Discovery Interviews (n=50)

**Target Audience:**
- Homeowners aged 30-55
- Household income $75K+
- Own their home for 2+ years
- Considering or recently completed a renovation

**Interview Questions:**
1. "Tell me about the last time you considered a home improvement project. What happened?"
2. "What prevented you from starting the project sooner?"
3. "How long did it take from initial idea to getting your first contractor quote?"
4. "How many contractor quotes did you get? What was the price range?"
5. "What was the most frustrating part of the process?"
6. "If you could wave a magic wand, what would make home improvement easier?"
7. "How much time did you spend researching materials, costs, and design options?"
8. "What would have helped you make a decision faster?"

**Success Criteria:**
- ≥60% mention cost uncertainty as a barrier
- ≥50% spent 2+ weeks in research phase
- ≥40% received quotes with >30% variance
- ≥70% express frustration with current process

**Timeline:** Weeks 1-3  
**Budget:** $500 (incentives: $10 gift card per interview)
