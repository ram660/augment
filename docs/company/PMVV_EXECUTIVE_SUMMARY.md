## 🎯 Strategic Positioning

### Who We Are

**For** homeowners, DIY enthusiasts, and contractors **who are frustrated by** the complexity, cost uncertainty, and miscommunication in home improvement projects,

**HomerView AI is** an intelligent home platform **that** transforms a few photos and a floor plan into a complete digital twin with AI-powered design options, accurate cost estimates, and collaborative tools—

**Unlike** HomeDesigns.ai (design-only) or traditional project management tools (no AI intelligence), **HomerView AI** combines instant visual transformations with agentic AI that automatically handles dimension matching, cost estimation, product discovery, and contractor coordination—

**So that** users can go from "I wonder what this could look like" to "Here's exactly what it will cost and who can build it" in minutes, not weeks.
